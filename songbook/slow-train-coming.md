Intro: G D A   G D A

         G      D       A
From the moment I first  saw you
       G        D        A
I knew I should turn and run
      G          D       A
But I can't seem to stop cravin'
    G       D         A
The tremble from your touch
      G     D           A
And I don't know how it happened
       G        D        A
But it happened just the same
     G      D      A
That bitter sweet addiction
      G        D          A
Keeps rushin' through my brain

        G       D      A
Bridge: Wheels are in motion
 G    D    E7
Time feels frozen


              A                D
Chorus: I can hear it rollin' 
                       A
Lord I know there's a 
                  G     D 
Heartache closing in on me
A                    
My hearts tied down 
G                    A
To these tracks now
                 G        D
I can't seem to break it free
C               D
Baby your sweet lovin'
          C    D      A
Is like a slow train comin'

       G        D     A
It's a constant contradiction
        G      D       A
I can't go and I can't stay
       G      D   A
It's a no win situation
           G       D      A
It's gonna hurt me either way

              G       D      A
Bridge: I can see the end in sight
    G          D        E7
But I'll just close my eyes

            A                D
Chorus: I can hear it rollin' 
                       A
Lord I know there's a 
                  G     D 
Heartache closing in on me
A                    
My hearts tied down 
G                    A
To these tracks now
                 G        D
I can't seem to break it free
C               D
Baby your sweet lovin'
          C    D     A
Is like a slow train comin'

         C                      D
Oh you'd think by now that I'd learned my lesson
        C                     G          A
But it feels so right that I keep forgettin'

                        
      A                D
I can hear it rollin' 
                       A
Lord I know there's a 
                  G     D 
Heartache closing in on me

A                    
My heart's tied down 
G                    D
To these tracks now
                 G        D
I can't seem to break it free

C                D
Baby your sweet lovin' 
C                G
Baby your sweet lovin'
C                D
Baby your sweet lovin'         
          C     G    A
Is like a slow train comin'

G D A  G D A  X4
