[Verse]
 
E
I sing myself to sleep
A               B
A song from the darkest hour
E
Secrets I can't keep
A             B
Inside of the day
 
E
I swing from high to deep
A           B
Extremes of sweet and sour
E
Hope that God exists
A         B
I hope, I pray
 
E
Drawn by the undertow
A                 B
My life is out of control
E                                A                B
I believe this wave will bear my weight so let it flow

 
[Chorus]
 
E
Oh sit down, Oh sit down, Oh sit down
A                B
Sit down next to me
E                          A    B
Sit down down down down down in sympathy
 
 
[Verse]
 
E
Now I'm relieved to hear
           A              B
That you've been to some far out places
      E
It's hard to carry on
         A        B
When you feel all alone
 
E
The wisdom that I seek
           A              B
Has been found in the strangest places
E
Feels a lot like love
           A              B
That I feel for you
 
E
Now I've swung back down again
       A                 B
It's worse than it was before
     E
If I hadn't seen such riches
         A               B
I could live with being poor
 
 
[Chorus]
 
E
Oh sit down oh sit down oh sit down
A                B
Sit down next to me
E                          A    B
Sit down down down down down in sympathy
 
 
[Bridge]
 
E
Those who feel the breath of sadness
A                B
Sit down next to me
E
Those who find they're touched by madness
A                B
Sit down next to me
E
Those who find themselves ridiculous
A                B
Sit down next to me
 
E
In love, in fear, in hate, in tears
A                  B
In love, in fear, in hate, in tears
E
In love, in fear, in hate, in tears
A                  B
In love, in fear, in hate
 
 
[Chorus]
 
E
Oh sit down, oh sit down, oh sit down
A                B
Sit down next to me
E                          A    B
Sit down down down down down in sympathy
 
(Keep repeating the same E A B pattern.)
