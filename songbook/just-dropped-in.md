Just Dropped In To See What Condition My Condition Was In
(Kenny Rogers and The First Edition)

(yeah, yeah, oh-yeah, what condition my condition was in)
 
  Dm                            G               Dm
I woke up this mornin' with the sundown shinin' in
  Dm                                     A7
I found my mind in a brown paper bag within
  Dm                            F                   G
I tripped on a cloud and fell-a eight miles high, I tore my mind 
                                                            on a jagged sky
  Dm                 A7                       Dm
I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in
 
(yeah, yeah, oh-yeah, what condition my condition was in)

  D#m                  Ab7                       D#m
  Dm                   G                         Dm
I pushed my soul in a deep dark hole and then I followed it in
  D#m                                     A#7
  Dm                                     A7
I watched myself crawlin' out as I was a-crawlin' in
      D#m            Gb                 Ab7
      Dm             F                  G7
I got up so tight I couldn't unwind, I saw so much I broke my mind
  D#m                 A#7                       D#m
  Dm                   G                         Dm
I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in

(yeah, yeah, oh-yeah, what condition my condition was in)
 
    Em                A7                               Em
    Dm                   G                         Dm
Someone painted "April Fool" in big black letters on a "dead end" sign
         Em                                         B7
         Dm                                         A7
I had my foot on the gas as I left the road and blew out my mind
      Em                       G                   A7
      Dm                       F                   G7
Eight miles outta Memphis and I got no spare, eight miles 
                                            straight up downtown somewhere
   Em               B7                       Em
   Dm               G                        Dm
I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in
