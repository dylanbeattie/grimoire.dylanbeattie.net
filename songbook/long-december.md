[Intro]
| D  G  | Em  G | D  G  | Em    |
 
[Verse]
G             D                  A           Em
A long December and there's reason to believe
      G                D               G
Maybe this year will be better than the last
Em               G      D                        A
   I can't remember the last thing that you said
            Em
as you were leavin'
        D             G
Now the days go by so fast
 
[Chorus]
         D               G         Em    G
And it's one more day up in the canyons
         D                 G       Em
And it's one more night in Hollywood
       D                  G        Em -stop-           D
If you think that I could be forgiven...I wish you would
  G   Em  G  D   G   Em   Em
nanananananananana.. yeah
 
[Verse]
G                 D            A
The smell of hospitals in winter
        Em                G            D               G
And the feeling that it's all a lot of oysters, but no pearls
Em        G              D               A
   All at once you look across a crowded room
           Em              D            G
To see the way that light attaches to a girl
 
[Chorus]
         D               G         Em    G
And it's one more day up in the canyons
         D               G         Em
And it's one more night in Hollywood
             D                 G      Em -stop-         D
If you think you might come to California...I think you should
  G   Em  G   D   G   Em
nanananananananana.. yeah
 
[Break]
| D  G  | Em  G  | D  G  | Em    |
 
[Verse]
G               D              A              Em
Drove up to the Hillside Manor sometime after two a.m.
    G               D               G
And talked a little while about the year
Em          G                D              A
I guess the winter makes you laugh a little slower
          Em            D
Makes you talk a little lower about
    G
the things you could not show her
 
[Chorus]
                G      D                  A            Em
And it's been a long December and there's reason to believe
      G                 D               G
Maybe this year will be better than the last
Em        G                D                A
  I can't remember all the times I tried to tell myself
Em                  D               G
To hold on to these moments as they pass
 
[Outro]
         D               G         Em    G
And it's one more day up in the canyon
         D               G         Em
And it's one more night in Hollywood
         D                  G        Em -stop-           D
It's been so long since I've seen the ocean...I guess I should
  G   Em  G   D   G   Em   Em  D
nanananananananana.... yeah
  G   Em  G   D   G   Em   Em
nanananananananana.... yeah
