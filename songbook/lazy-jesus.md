[Intro: A7 A   A7 A   A7 A   A7 A]

       A7 A      A7 A              A7sus4 D      A7sus4 D
One not so sunny afternoon, in the winter of 22,
      E7 E              E7 E          A7 A      A7 A
I was out and trying to find my happy place,
       A7 A      A7 A                 A7sus4-D      A7sus4-D
Southbound on the High Street, took a left and then a right,
        E7 E              E7 E        A7 A      A7 A
Walked in and put a smile right on my face,

   A               C#m          D                  Dm
Outside the sky is crying, Wind blowing up a hurri-cane,
    A               F#m        E              A7 A  (A7-A x 3)
I'm praying to Lazy Jesus, and waiting for my train

! - on a road to nowhere, living reckless, living free,
Be careful you don't wander off your course,
Start small, bear in mind, Jack is two and Ursus three,
And the fourth one could be grounds for divorce,

Outside the sky is crying, wind blowing up a hurricane,
I'm praying to Lazy Jesus, and waiting for my train

! - when summer comes we should all head out to the lake,
Superior days wait upon the shore,
And if the fates allow it, walk the paths you won't take
'Til happy golden days are here once more

Outside the sky is crying, wind blowing up a hurricane,
So I'm praying to Lazy Jesus, while I'm waiting for my train 

So when you feel like a deserter who the world has left behind,
Try chasing waterfalls, and a field of gold,
Now I'm homeward bound and happy, got a venture on my mind, 
But my last train's gone and left me in the cold

Outside the sky is crying, wind blowing up a hurricane,
So I'm praying to Lazy Jesus, and I'm walking home in the rain
