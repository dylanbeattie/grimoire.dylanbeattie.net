[Intro]
G                         C  Em  D   G     D  Em  C  Em  D  G  F
   I am the one and only,             Oh yeah!

[Verse 1]
Em                G   C
Call me, call me by my name or
          G   Am     G                 
call me by my number Put me through it
C                            D
  I'll still be doing it the way I do it
Gm                   A#     D#    A#      Cm
And yet you try to make me forget Who I really am
      A#                D#            F               G
don't tell me I'd know best I'm not the same as all the rest
 
[Chorus]
G        D      Em    C    Em       D      G
I am the one and only   No body I'd rather be
         D      Em    C                Em    D          G      F
I am the one and only   You can't take that away from me
 
[Verse 2]
Em                 G     C                        G    Am
I've been a player in the crowd scene A flicker on the big screen
G                 C              D
My soul embraces one more in a million faces
Gm                 A#        D#            A#     Cm
High hopes and aspirations, ideas above my station, maybe
    A#               D#             F           G
but all this time I tried to walk with dignity and pride
 
[Chorus]
 
[Bridge]
F                           Dm
  I can't wear this uniform   Without some compromises
D#                                      Cm
  Because you'll find out that we come In different shapes and sizes
 
[Short Verse 3]
Fm              G#         C#                G#      A#m
No one can be myself like I can For this job I'm the best man

     G#               C#            D#            F
And while this maybe true, you are the one and only you!
 
[Guitar solo, or Chorus in A]

[Chorus]
G        D      Em    C   Em      D     G
I am the one and only No body I'd rather be
         D      Em    C               Em   D       G
I am the one and only You can't take that away from me
